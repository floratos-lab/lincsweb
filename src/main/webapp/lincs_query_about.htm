			</p>
			<p>This component provides for query and display of data
				generated by the Columbia LINCS Technology U01 and Computation U01
				Centers. It provides experimental and computational results for drug
				mode of action and similarity calculations, and for synergy
				experiments.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Synergy Experiments</b> - Using any of a variety of assays, drugs
				are tested in combination to determine if they have a greater effect
				together than the sum of their separate effects. The synergy
				experiments are being carried out at the Columbia High-Throughput
				Screening Facility.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Functional mode of action</b> - The Functional Mode of Action
				(fMoA) of drugs is being calculated using the Viper program. Viper
				uses a cell-context (e.g. tissue) specific interaction network
				(interactome), reverse engineered from a large number of expression
				profiles using the ARACNe algorithm, and also individual expression
				profiles generated for each tested drug. The interaction network
				contains the list of target regulated genes (the <b>regulon</b>) for
				each transcription factor (TF) in the context of the tissue tested.
				Using the interaction network, Viper calculates the enrichment of
				the regulon of each TF in the list of differentially expressed genes
				produced for each drug. Thus the effect of each drug can be
				represented as the activity profile of its TFs, and this is termed
				the functional mode of action of the drug.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Similarity</b> - The similarity between the fMoA profiles of each
				drug can be calculated, e.g. using GSEA. The similarity scores can
				be used as a basis to predict whether the two compared drugs will be
				synergistic in their action. The hypothesis initially being tested
				is that drugs that are most dissimilar will have a greater
				probability of acting synergistically.

					Query and Display</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Query for experimental synergy results for tested drug pairs,
				or computational drug similarity results based on gene expression
				experiments. In the current experimental design, drug 1 and drug 2
				are not symmetric; they are generally drawn from separate lists of
				compounds. This difference is preserved in the database.</p>
			<p>For currently loaded experimental (synergy) data, drug 1
				corresponds to a list of 100 "sensitizer" drugs chosen to maximally
				orthogonal to each other in their mode of action. Drug 2 corresponds
				to a set of 10 "effector" compounds of known mode of action.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Tissue Type</b> - The tissue from which the tested cell
					line was originally derived. More than one tissue can be chosen for
					a single query.</li>
				<li><b>Cell Line</b> - The cell line tested in a particular
					experiment. More than one cell line can be chosen for a single
					query (multiple selection), subject to any constraint on "Tissue
					Type".</li>
				<li><b>Drug 1</b> - Entries stored as "drug 1" in a pair,
					subject to previous choices of tissue type or cell line, if any. <b>One
						or more drugs (multiple selection) must be chosen</b>. (For plotting a
					Heatmap, a multiple selection is counted as a free variable, as
					though no selection had been made).</li>
				<li><b>Drug 2</b> - Entries stored as "drug 2" in a pair, given
					current constraints on tissue type, cell line, and drug 1. More
					than one drug can be chosen for a single query (multiple
					selection). (For plotting a Heatmap, a multiple selection is
					counted as a free variable, as though no selection had been made).</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Dynamic Search on Drug 1</b> - currently the number of
					drugs in "Drug 1" can be considerably larger than in "Drug 2". For
					this reason, a dynamic search box is offered above the "Drug 1"
					selection. As each character is typed, the "Drug 1" list will be
					updated to only show matching drugs.
					<ul>
						<li>The match is not case-sensitive.</li>
						<li>The match can occur anywhere in the drug name.</li>

			<p>Radio buttons are used to select whether to query for
				experimental or computational results. Only one type can be chosen
				at a time. These result types are held in separate tables in the
				database and the scores have different ranges.</p>
			<p>The controls specific to each type are:</p>
			<h3>
				<span class="mw-headline" id="Experimental">Experimental</span>
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Assay Type</b> (phenotypic readout): Viability,
					proliferation, apoptosis, cell morphology, oxidization state, etc.</li>
				<li><b>Synergy Measure</b> (Excess over Bliss, Excess over
					highest single agent, Combination Index, etc.).</li>
			 
			</ul>
			<h3>
				<span class="mw-headline" id="Computational">Computational</span>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Similarity Algorithm</b> (MARINa (GSEA-2), IDEA, DEMAND,

				<li><b>Search</b> - Search the database for all results
					matching the constraints, and display the result in the spreadsheet

<fields>
<TissueType>The tissue from which the tested cell line was originally derived. More than one tissue can be chosen for a single query.</TissueType>
<CellLine>The cell line tested in a particular experiment. More than one cell line can be chosen for a single query (multiple selection), subject to any constraint on "Tissue Type".</CellLine>
<Drug1>Entries stored as "drug 1" in a pair, subject to previous choices of tissue type or cell line, if any. More than one drug can be chosen for a single query (multiple selection)</Drug1>
<Drug2>Entries stored as "drug 2" in a pair, given current constraints on tissue type, cell line, and drug 1. More than one drug can be chosen for a single query (multiple selection)</Drug2>
<AssayType>Viability, proliferation, apoptosis, cell morphology, oxidization state, etc.</AssayType>
<SynergyMeasure>Excess over Bliss, Excess over highest single agent, Combination Index, etc.</SynergyMeasure>
<SimilarityAlgorithm> This entry will combine the algorithm used with the similarity method used, e.g. GSEA-2, in the case where an algorithm has more than one possible measure.(MARINa (GSEA-2), IDEA, DEMAND, combined, etc.).</SimilarityAlgorithm>
